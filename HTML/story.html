                        <li>Alfred Guac decided he wanted to make a world phenomenon, so he created the Guacamole revolution!
                        With this idea in mind he created The Guac Shoppe in Avocolorado, Colorado.</li>

                        <li>Mr. Guac created a flourishing business, hipsters began to come out of the woodworks from all around
                        to taste this magnificent guacamole. With this added success, Mr. Guac took it upon himself to expand the
                        menu to include 3 more guacamole related foods: The taco, the burrito, and the quesadilla.</li>

                    <ul class="events">
                        <li>In the year 2000, just as the everyone had predicted, the world had come to an end. People no longer
                        craved guacamole, they wanted something different. Mr. Guac had only a few regular customers left, and began
                        a long hard struggle to keep his business alive.</li>

                    <ul class="events">
                        <li>At the bottom of the barrel, Mr. Guac faced the lowest point in his career and almost had to close up
                        shop. However, the saving grace known as the Colorado Amendment 64 occurred, effectively legalizing
                        marijuana in Colorado. With this, cannabis users from around the country flocked to Colorado and sales of
                        Guacamole skyrocketed.</li>
